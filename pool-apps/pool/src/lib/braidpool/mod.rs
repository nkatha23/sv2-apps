//! Braidpool-specific types bridging the SV2 pool to the braidpool node.
//!
//! This module is the boundary layer between the generic SV2 pool and
//! Braidpool's bead-based consensus. It defines the types that flow from
//! the pool (where shares are validated) to the node (where beads are built).
//!
//! # Data flow
//! ```text
//! SubmitSharesExtended
//!   → validate_share (ExtendedChannel)
//!   → ValidatedShare  ──[ShareBridgeSender]──► node::propagate_valid_bead  (PR 4)
//! ```
